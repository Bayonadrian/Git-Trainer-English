To start with git, we must first tell it who we are, this is done through the following commands:

- $ git config --global user.name <name>
- $ git config --global user.email <email>

Instead of <name>, you must register your name, and instead of <email>, you must register your email. Once this is done you must start the repository, using the following command:

-git init

This generates a hidden repository in the folder, this repository is called ".git".

Note: If you want to pull a github repository, you need to use the command:

-git clone url

Putting the url of the repository you want to clone.
