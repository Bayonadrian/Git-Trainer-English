Hello, I am a bot created to teach you how to use git, the first step is to install it, if you have any doubts about it I recommend you use this link: https://youtu.be/FHU7JHJDsAU, once installed you have two options , use the /quickstart command to access the basic tutorial, the /manual command to access the manual, and the /help command to access the basic list of commands.
