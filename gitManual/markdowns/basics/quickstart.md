Welcome to the quick start, I recommend you start with this video: https://youtu.be/HiXLkL42tMU, once you have seen it I give you a list of steps:

- /stepTwo -> Step Two(status, add, commit)
- /stepTree -> Third step(show, log, diff)
- /stepFour -> Fourth step(reset, checkout)
- /stepFive -> Step Five(branch, checkout, merge)
- /stepSix -> Sixth step(remote, push, pull)
